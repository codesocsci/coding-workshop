# Workshop Prep 

1. Have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
2. Fork or import this [repository](https://github.com/evanwill/workshop-template).
3. Probably want to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and a nice [text editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed (although you could do it all in the GitHub web interface if you *really* wanted to).
