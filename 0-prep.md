# Workshop Prep

1. Have [Stata](https://www.stata.com) installed
2. Have a text editor you are comfortable with installed. While you can use the built in editor in Stata, there are more powerful options with syntax highlighting and a more robust copy-paste features (see [here](http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/bocode/t/textEditors.html)).
  - I personally use [Atom](https://atom.io/) with the [`language-stata`](https://atom.io/packages/language-stata) and [`stata-exec`](https://atom.io/packages/stata-exec) packages by [Kyle Barron](https://github.com/kylebarron).
  - I have used [Textwranger](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) (a mac specific app) with Stata integration courtesy of [Jonathan Bearak](http://bearak.org/code/text/) in the past.
  - There are many other options. The choice of a text editor is often deeply personal. The longer you're at this, the more preferences you'll develop. Don't worry if it seems overwhelming right now. 
3. Have an open mind about writing code. It isn't hard; just something to learn.
