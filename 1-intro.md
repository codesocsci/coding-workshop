# Introduction

Code in Stata is housing in `.do` files. These are text files with a `.do` file extension that Stata recognizes as containing code it can run. From a `.do` file, we can open data files, import text and other kinds of non-Stata data files, create and modify variables, and run statistical analyses. Importantly, a `.do` file contains a record of all of the data cleaning and preparation, modifications, and analyses you've run for a particular project. Maintaining a clean and readable `.do` file is incredibly helpful in the research process, especially when you've been away from the project for some time.
